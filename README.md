# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer  

Welcome to the **Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer**, an interactive tool designed to help you visualize and understand popular pathfinding algorithms. With a user-friendly interface, this application demonstrates how algorithms like **Dijkstra**, **A* (A-Star)**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)** find the shortest path between two points in a grid.

---

## âœ¨ Features  

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to add walls, customize the grid layout.  
- **Algorithm Demonstration**: Watch step-by-step visualizations of pathfinding algorithms in action.  
- **Dynamic Visualization**: See the process unfold in real-time, showcasing how algorithms explore and find paths.   
- **Clean UI**: Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and modern design.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used  

- **Vite**: For lightning-fast development.  
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and maintainability.  
- **React**: For a dynamic and modular frontend.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For sleek and responsive styling.

## ðŸ“š How to Use

1. Add Obstacles

2. Click or drag on the grid to create walls that block the path. Or create obstacles automatically using the maze dropdown, which can create obsctacles for you using binary tree and recursive division methods.

3. Choose an Algorithm

4. Visualize
Hit the play button to watch the algorithm find the shortest path!

5. Reset
Clear the grid to try again with a different configuration or algorithm.
